## Module 2 Homework
Module 2 - VBA 

### Homework Submission Files
Including:
* 3 screenshots of the results for each year (2018, 2019, 2020)
* 2 separate .vbs files, one for each sub.

### Note
In the challenge requirements, they say to both match the picture and add conditional formatting for the percent change column. This is a little confusing. It is unclear if the red/green formatting is needed for the percent change column, similar to the yearly change column, as the picture doesn't show that being the case. Here I have included the percent (%) formatting but I didn't format it to match the yearly change column with the red/green coloring since it would not add any additional value and it would match the yearly change column.
